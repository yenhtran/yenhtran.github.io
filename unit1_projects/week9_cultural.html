			<h3>Getting the Answers: Asking the right questions</h3>
			<p>It's the evening before I start Dev Bootcamp and as I approach this blog, I've realized that I have a hard time asking for help. The idea of posting my idiot question online where everyone can see is most terrifying. Yes, I NEED TO GET OVER THIS and will likely be one of the biggest challenge I have to get over during these 9 weeks. </p>

			<p>So before I start asking berating people with questions, I thought the reading material <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask" target="_blank">How to ask a good question</a> was particularly useful and enlightenting.</p>

			<h3>Some great tips:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Write a title that summarizes the specific problem.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague.</li>
					<li>Spelling, grammer and punctuation are important!</li>
					<li>Write the title last! (You're have a better title.)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Introduce the problem before you post your code.</li>
				<li>Help others reproduce the problem.</li>
				<li>Include all relavant tags.</li>
				<li>Proof-read before posting!</li>
				<li>Post the question and respond to feedback.</li>
				<li>Look for help asking for help.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Look out! It's about to get real.</p>
