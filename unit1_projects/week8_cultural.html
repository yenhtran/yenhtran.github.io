			<h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>
			<p>Conflicts- they uncomfortable and many times can get pretty ugly. However what I have learned in my professional career that as you obtain higher leadership positions, the more likelihood that you will encounter conflict.</p>

			<p>I believe the keys to dealing with conflict is listening and being able to stay calm underfire. Did you ever watch the Karate Kid? Remember Mr. Miyagi and remember how calm he was during THE ENTIRE movie? You didn't see a single emotion come out of him? Whenever someone came to him yelling, whining, and screaming, he had the most calm disposition that you wondered if the man was even awake during the movie.</p>

			<p>Being able to stay calm under pressure has been a huge benefit to my professional pressence and they way people have interacted with me. I think by staying calm when someone is ranting against you weirdly gives you the upperhand in the situation. It also gives you an opportunity to hear out what is bothering the other person and see if there are miscommunications underlining the issue.</p>

			<p>So the next time you deal with conflict, listen and try to empathize with your opponent to see if there are any miscommunciations. Be sure to stay calm like Mr. Miyagi.</p>
