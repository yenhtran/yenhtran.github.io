			<h3>Growth</h3>
			<p>In the past couple of year, what I have discovered about myself is that I am the most happiest when I feel like I am progressing forward to a end-goal. I am a firm believer in life-long learning and focusing on growth I believe will always have me moving towards the next level of success; whether it be in my career, heatlth, relationships, etc. This was further justified when I discovered that when I was the most unhappiest was when I was stagggnant in my career, health, relationship, etc. Blame it on the "rat-race" mentality and not wanting to be left behind or just social cultures.</p>

			<em>John Maxwell wisely said, "Growth today is an investment for tomorrow."</em>

			<p>I believe for the most part that I strive for growth everyday. In the first couple of years in my career at the Haas School of Business, I grew and developed important soft-skills and network. I felt incredibly happy because I felt that as hard as I worked, I was investing in my future through growth.</p>

			<p>After I a couple years, I needed a physical outlet and started getting into martial arts. I trained about 5-6 times a week, and every day I knew that I was growing as a Jiujitsu/Grappling fighter. In 2013, I finally competed in my first ever Jiujitsu tournament. While I didn't win, I was most happy with my journey to that point.</p>

			<p>Flashforward to today and I am my next pivot in my growth in my career as will be starting as a student at Dev Bootcamp. I have already l`earned and grown so much in the last 9 weeks. Like my years at Haas and Jiujitsu, the journey is going to be tough, but I know that with my soft-skills I received from Haas, confidence from Jiujitsu, and now these hard-skills from Dev Bootcamp, I will continue my growth as a life-long member of society.</p>
