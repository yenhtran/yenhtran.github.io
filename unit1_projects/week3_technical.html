		<h2>JavaScript</h2>

		<p>This blog will attempt to try to showcase the popularity of JavaScript in Web Development.</p>

		<h3>Why is JavaScript (Js) popular in web development?</h3>

		<ol>
			<li><p>Js is the only programming language that runs both in the frontend and the backend. Js also comes installed on every modern web browser vs. other languages where you have to install in your machine. Also, since Js is used on the frontend and runs al the interactive elements of a website, you see immediate return.</p></li>

			<li><p>Due to the introduction of AJAX, Js began to explode in popularity because AJAX allowed Js to work with data on the backend and allow for much more interations onwebsites. It is also used on mobile web devices.</p></li>

			<li><p>Job Security (article was written April, 2014)</br>
			Due to explosion in popularity of Js, many employers are looking to hire people with Js skills. Just to list a few, 'JavaScript' is a keyword on most job posts on Indeed, jQuery (a popular Js library) is ranked #8 on the fastest growing keywords.</p></li>

		<h3>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h3>

		<ol>
			<li><p><strong>Shortcut notations</strong> - Javascript used to be much more complicated to type out, but due to new shorcut notations, many objects and arrays have easy shortcuts that seem to be popular with web developers.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>JSON as a Data Format</strong> - Before the introduction of JSON, it sounds like getting content into a JavaScript-ready format was quite extensive. With the introduction of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a lightweight data-interchange format, allowed developers to store complex data in a format that Js recognizes and can be used immediately.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>Native JavaScript Functions (Math, Array And String)</strong> - Prior to these functions being added to Js, people had to use a lot of looping and conditions. Due to these functions being added to Js, you can cut down a lot on these loops. In additona, a lot of other functions were added that makes like easier for a web developer.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>Event Delegation</strong> - Events make Web apps work. I'm not exactly sure what this does just yet, but it sounds like it makes products extensible without us needing to touch the core code.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>Anonymous Functions and The Module Pattern</strong> - In JavaScript, the variables usually don't have any scope, meaning that other scripts on the same page can access them and overide them. By using what is called 'The Module Pattern', allows one to build a variable's scope as needed by the user.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>Allowing for Configuration</strong> - You can add an object to your whole script called 'configuration'. In it, you store all the things people will likely change when using your script. Make the object public property so people can override it. You want to make it easy for people to use your code and alter it as needed.</p></li>

		<h3>What are it's limitations?</h3>

		<ol>
			<li><p><strong>No graphic capabilities.</strong> While JavaScript can dynamically generate HTML, change document styles, and run simple animations, it can't draw things</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>Can't read or write files.</strong> Js can't read or change the contents of your computer storage devices, but can request permission to do some form of file managment.</p></li>

			<li><p><strong>It does not know how to use the network.</strong> While it knows how to request the Web browser to send and retrieve information from the network, it cannot engage in any network activity of its own. </p></li>

		Hope this helped!</p>
