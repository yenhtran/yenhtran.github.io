		<h3>Khan Academy</h3>

		<p><strong>What problem is the webpage solving?</strong></br>
		The website is solving the problem of managing the intimidation of learning a new subject. By cutting up the subjects into bite-size 15min video modules, it captures the typical attention span of an individual. Also, by keeping the site's clutter to a minimum helps prevent distractions. (i.e. no marketing ads are located on any of the websites.)<br/>

		</br><strong>What visual challenges are there?</strong></br>
		</br>The visual challenges I see is that there is a lot of text in the Q&A section that makes the bottom half of the page look clutter. Consider categorizing by topic or similar questions. <br/></p>

		<h3>Bloomberg Visual Data</h3>

		<p><strong>What problem is the webpage solving?</strong><br/>
		<br/>I believe that data usually makes much more sense to the user when you provide context. For the most part, graphs in general solves this program. However, I believe these visual data pages allows the user to interact and select certain data points and view the corresponding data relative to what was selected. This allows users to be much more engaged in the study.<br/>

		<strong><br/>What visual challenges are there?</strong><br/>The visual challenges I see is a small one. Because some of the data points can be located very close to each other, the labels of these data points can end up overlapping an makes it look a little cluttered. <br/>

		<h3>Airbnb</h3>
		<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/San-Francisco--CA--United-States?checkin=05%2F31%2F2014&checkout=06%2F18%2F2014&source=bb" target="_blank"><img src="images/Airbnb_wireframe.jpg"></a><br/>
			
		<p><br/><strong>What problem is the webpage solving?</strong><br/>
		<br/>The big problem the webpage is solving and by correlating location of the rental to where it is located in the city. By having the map right next to photos of the rentals allows for easy navigation and perspective for the user on where they would like to be in the city. I believe Airbnb does a great job of understanding their user base. Individuals who usually use these types of rentals are looking for a clean, safe, and affordable accommodations, without the luxuries of an expensive hotel. The website reflects that mentality. The website is clean, simple and no pretentious graphics.<br/>

		<strong><br/>What visual challenges are there?</strong><br/>
		<br/>I wish they would add a 'walk-score' filter option to the map. If I am coming to visit a city and am in need of accommodations, it is likely that I am not going to be very familiar with the neighborhood. By having a walk-score filter allows me to see which neighbourhoods are safe and walkable.<br/></p>
