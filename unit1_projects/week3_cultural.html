		<h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style: Abstract Random</h3>
		<p>(Followed closely by Concrete Sequential by 4 pts!)<br/><br/>

		<p><strong><em>Question:</em> Based on your thinking style, how can you use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn?</strong><br/>

		<p>Since it looks like my learning style is right smack in the middle between AR and CS, I took a look at both learning styles and found that there are certain aspect of my life where I agree with one thinking style, and other aspect of my life that I'm leaning towards the other. I think how I will be use what I've learned from my thinking style is to take the middle path of learning on your own as much as you can and then lean on the DBC community for help. </p>

		<p><strong><em>Question:</em> Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place?</strong><br/>

		<p>My biggest struggle so far has been I feel disorganized in my learning and solving problems. Because I see the large amount of work each week that needs to get done (and hold down a full-time job), I feel rushed to get all the deliverables done. And due to feeling rushed, I feel like I'm not dedicating enough time on the foundations and am getting frustrated and anxious. I feel disorganized and drowning most of the time.<p>

		<p>There are times when I am frustrated with the curriculum material. I feel like there are gaps in the direction we were given to learn and what is expected in the challenges. I guess that's where my concrete sequential side comes into play. When I'm learning, I need it to be in a 'sequential step-by-step linear progression'. So this style of 'Read this site, check-out this webpage, read some of this(click here)'' is very uncomfortable to me. (Week One was AWFUL) I'm used to lesson plans, and workbooks that once I've mastered one concept (and I have validation that I have mastered a concept), I can move on. It's something I have to get used to and try to hang on as much as possible.</p>

		<p>There are however some bright spots. I really enjoyed the students I have met so far at DBC. Everyone is so nice and eager to help with my understanding of the material. (To the point where I actually feel awful that I haven't been able to contribute any substantial help to anyone.) I guess this is where my Abstract Random side kicks in. I am a very person oriented and like to feel like there are humans out there I can reach out to for help.<p>

		<p>There are a couple of strategies that I hope I can put into place:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Time Management and Focus</strong>- There were some great tips in Week 2 about time management that I hope to put into play. (I want a Pomodoro!)</li>
				<li><strong>Slow Down (and be okay with it)</strong> Hopefully with a better time management structure, I can try and slow down when it comes to focusing on the basics. These learning leaps are driving me crazy. Worst case scenario? Kelly holds be back a cohort- Oh well, I'll deal. </li>
				<l1><strong>Plan a weekly study-group</strong>-I would like to try and put together a study-group for DBC folks in my area once/twice a week. Hang out, code and commiserate together. I just need to find a place to meet up...</li>
				<li><strong>Program more during the week</strong> I need to find sometime to squeeze some learning time into my work-week. I miss my weekends and am tired of dedicating all of it to programming. It's making me misarable.</li>
				<li><strong>Sleep!</strong> I'm not going to remember any of it if I don't get more sleep.</li>
			</ol>

		<p><strong><em>Question:</em> Now consider the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.</strong><br/>

		<p>I think my nature makes me naturally persistant. Even when I am misarable, I usually persist on. I embrace challenges and wanting to challenge myself, but at times hate how hard it is. I think there are going to be times where I might need to take a step back and crack open a HTML,CSS and JavaScript book when I feel like I'm 'drowning' and not understanding the fundamentals. Once I feel like I've grasped a concept, I'll jump back in.</p>

		<p>Okay, time for bed. Thanks for reading!</p>
