		<h3>What is stereotype threat?</h3>
		<h2>Answer: "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group"</h2>

		<p>My most recent experience with stereotype threat was back when I was in school at Berkeley. Up until then, I had been a good student and excelled in math and science. Unfortunately due to a combination of issues, including what I suspect now is what we call stereotype threat, I gave up on math and and science. I remember attending one of the core calculus classes in my first year at Berkeley and seeing a sea of men and a very small percentage of girls in the class. I honestly don't know why I didn't perserver on, but I do regret not pursue math and science now that I have left school for a couple of years. Whether it was because of steretype threat or not, I promised myself that I was never going to not pursue something because of a stereotype.</p>

		<p>Today, I have made myself a promise to not succomb to social stereotypes and the effect that stereotype threat can have on anyone. Even today when I tell people that I am going to attend DBC, I have individuals (and some are successful people I look to as mentors) that question my decision (and sanity) to attend DBC. I have an inkling that part of the reason may be that I may not fit into the stereotype image they have in their heads.</p>

		<p>I have discovered in the last couple of years that I actually enjoy trying to break stereotypes that come with being an Asian-American woman. I am sometimes loud, who speaks her mind (vs. the quiet and passive stereotype we get); not an accountant or works at a nail salon (I'm part Vietnamese) and enjoys MMA style activities (Krav Maga, Brazillian JiuJitsu). On that last point, I think training in martial arts has been an eye-opening experience in regards to stereotypes. MMA is very much a male-dominated sport. When I first started, I was the only girl in the class. The first couple of classes were hard and the constant take-downs by they big guys took a toll on my body. But I was determined not to give up because I WAS the only girl in the class. A year later, I found myself in more often in the dominant positions and taking them down. I realized then that regardless of whatever stereotype is out there (and there always will be and changing), you have to give 110% and keep your eye on the prize. And to me, that's how you break stereotypes.</p>
