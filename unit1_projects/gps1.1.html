        Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

        While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

        <p class="reflection"><strong>Alan & Yen's Reflection:</strong> We enjoyed this experience and learned a lot from each other and from working with John. What we really enjoyed was learning/sharing tips and tricks with each other. It was nice to see what he emphasized as someone who attended the program earlier. What doesn't work as well is html pairing as it would with programming due to multiple pages.</p>
