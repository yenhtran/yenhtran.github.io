		<h3>Feedback: A necessary evil</h3>

		<p>First off, I would like to say that I already love my Firecracker cohort! I have not had one less than stellar pair programming session.(Okay, maybe there was just one.) Everyone that I have met is super nice and dedicated and I am so excited to meet all of you later this summer!</p>

		<p><strong>PAIRING</strong><br/>

		<p><em>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</em><br/>	

		<p>I actually very much enjoy pairing with others in my class to solve challenges. I was amazed at the importance of bouncing ideas off one another to solve a problem, even though both of us might not know how to actually solve it. In addition, having two people searching for methods speeds the process up by 2x!</p>

		<p><em>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</em><br/>	

		<p>I'm a social learner and person in general. So after spending many hours isolated trying to study this material, it's nice to have someone to talke to and commesorate with. In addition, it's incredibly rewarding to actually solve a problem with a pair.</p>

		<p><em>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</em><br/>

		<p>I think the most frustrating thing about pairing is that I constantly feel like I am not contributing to the challenge because I don't feel confident about the material. I am constantly feeling that I am letting my pair down because I didn't prepare enought and therefore feel like I don't have much to contribute.</p>

		<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong><br/>

		<p><em>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</em><br/>	

		<p>It was a little nerve-racking when I opened up Socrates to go get my feedback. I was nervous about what others were going to write about me. However, I was pleasantly surprised to read all the nice feedback. There were also a couple of very good constructive feedback that I plan to incorporate in my next pair programming session. The one that keeps coming back is my need to be more confident in my learning. </p>

		<p><em>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</em><br/>

		<p>Yes, I do believe the feedback will be helpful to my learning. Other people veiw you differently than you do yourself, and often times they are less critical than you are on yourself.</p>

		<p><em>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve the next time you pair?</em><br/>

		<p> I think I'm going to try and be more confident in my understanding of the content and also not be so hard on myself either.</p>

		<p><em>How was it to write feedback? What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</em><br/>

		<p>Writing feedback is hard to write about great people! Since all my pairs so far has been incredibly awesome, I find myself struggling to find constructive and specific feedback to give!</p>


		<p>Okay, time for bed. Thanks for reading!</p>
