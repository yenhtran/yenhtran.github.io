		<h3>Where The Ladiez At?</h3>

		<p>"Women account for just 6 percent of chief executives at the top 100 tech companies," and "they create only 8 percent of venture-backed startups." These are the current statistics of women in the tech industry and it's appalling. This blog is an attempt to discover how we got here, how it effects the technology landscape and how we can solve this problem.</p>

		<p><strong><em>What lead to the lack of women in tech?</strong></em><br/>

		<p>First off, lets see how we got here. I myself in my early years in high school was pretty good in math and science and I often ask myself why I didn't pursue those disciplines later in my college years? For me, and I believe for many women, was the lack of female models in tech and therefore the lack of encouragement to follow those disciplines. I definitely wish I had someone in my high school and later in my college years who could have encouraged me to continue and persue a STEM career path.</p>

			<p><em>"Studies have shown that when told that men score better in math tests than women, women tend to score worse. When told that isn't true, the two genders scored equally well.This might come from an "internal bias" in the minds of young female scientists, who may naturally under-rate their intelligence." </em></p>

		<p> Another reason that keeps women out of technology- stereotypes. "Research has indicated that when females are exposed to nerdy white-guy stereotypes, it discourages them from STEM fields." I will admit that these stereotypes had an effect on me in my college years. As an impressionable, directionless teenager, I didn't think I would be able to fit in these "nerdy white-guy" culture. In addition, the media in the 90's had also not helped the issue and constantly proprayed engineers as geeky and awkward.</p>

		<p>Lastly, and definitely not the least reason- childcare. "Women often time leave the STEM fields early in their career and a frequently suggested reason for this is the lack of maternity leave and childcare after having kids. This also goes hand-in-hand with the long-hour days of technology startups." Add to that the fact that cultural and social norms of men being the bread winners of the family and women being stay-at-home moms. This directly effected the number of women in the industry.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Why we need more women in tech</strong></em></p>

		<p>Now that we've touched on a couple of issues WHY women are not in tech. Let's now discuss why it is important to have more women in technology (and in any industry). According to <a href= "http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/12/why-do-we-need-more-women-in-technologyForbes" target="_blank">Forbes:</a></p>

			<ol>
				<li><em>"There will be less sexual harassment and discomfort when there's more women around...Studies have shown that the lack of women in certain fields leads to harassment and general increased discomfort. </li>
				<li>There would be less discrimination if it's not considered unusual for women to pursue tech careers. Because there are fewer women in the sciences, women face discrimination and sexism.</li>
				<li>Because more women in tech now will encourage more girls to pursue their own interest in tech (and will therefore enable greater equality). Having more women in tech now will mean more female tech leaders and more girls thinking, "hey, this is for me."</li>
				<li>Because we probably have a lack of innovation in certain (female oriented) sub-industries because there are fewer women in tech. People are less likely to start a company in a sub-industry that has no relationship to them. Thus, with fewer women in tech, the tech world will make much less of an impact on those fields. In others, innovations that could be happening probably isn't.</li>
				<li>Because women may think, act, or approach problems differently. Women and men think differently on average. For example, women tend to be more emotionally sensitive and more empathetic...Having a company made up of people who approach problems in different ways is good."</li></em>
			</ol>

		<p><strong><em>Ways we can encourage more women in tech</em></strong><br/>

		<p>Luckily the tides are turing; more and more women are now persuing STEM programs in colleges and university. However this doesn't mean we can let our guard down! Taken from <a href= "http://www.businessinsider.com/7-things-keeping-women-out-of-science-2013-10" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, below are some additional ways that we can continue to encourage girls and women into the field.</p>

			<ul>
				<em><li>"Encourage more women to take more STEM courses in school at a younger age.</li>
				<li>Add more men to the conversation. Fathers, husbands, brothers, should all have a voice in this conversation because often they do have the power to take proactive steps in correcting this imbalance.</li>
				<li>Media matters: There is a huge gender bias in today's media. On TV, the ratios of male to female characters has been exactly the same since 1946!  In movies, of the characters holding jobs, 81% are male.</li>
				<li>Change reading lists. Books with smart female protagonists aren't as rare anymore, but try finding a book with a female protagonist as an entrepreneur or programmer.  What kids read influences them more than we can imagine.</li>
				<li>Provide childcare</li>
				<li>And finally, get more women in tech so that there are more women role models in tech!"</li></em>
