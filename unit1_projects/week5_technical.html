		<h2>Where's the Class?</h2>

		<p>This blog will attempt to explain classes in the context of Ruby.</p>

		<p>But first, <strong>What is an Class in Ruby?</strong></p>
		<p>You can think of a class as a mold or template for creating objects in Ruby. This template allows one to create multiple objects that share similar behaviors or attributes. </p> 

		<p>Now lets create our Car class:</p>

		<p><strong>Instance Methods</strong>: Next we will need to use an instance method to initialize an instance of our Car class. Instance methods are methods defined inside a class and intended for use by all instances of the class.  An example we can look at is our Car class example. If we wanted to make a  we need to tell Ruby what basic attributes and behaviors to assign this car. We would need to use our instance method initialize to create an instance or our Car class. We would need a starting point and in this case we would need our car to have an engine, 4 tires, and a steering wheel.</p>

		<p>Introduce the <strong>Instance Variable</strong>. Instance variables serve the purpose of storing information for individual objects and are only visible to the object to which they belong. As you can see above, all instance variables start with the '@'.</p>

		<p>After running the program, we should get the following output:</p>

		<p>Whoo hoo! And now we have a new instance variable on the class Car!</p>
