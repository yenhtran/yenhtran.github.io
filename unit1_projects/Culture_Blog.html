		<h3>My Reflection</h3>
		<a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank"><img src="images/DBC_culture_photo.jpg"></a><br/>

		<p><strong><em>Question:</em> Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br/>

		<p>Ever since I made the decision to put my deposit down and join DBC, I've been through the gambit of emotions. From the 'I'm SO excited to join DBC!' to 'WTF am I thinking?!' Since then I've researched everything I can on the web about DBC, spoken to anyone I have met that went to the program/taught in the program, and anyone in the industry. My past 3 months has been on a DBC/tech industry research project. And since then, I've heard it all- the good, the bad, and the ugly (WTF-2am?!). What I found was whether or not they got a dev job from DBC, the common theme I do hear is that no one regrets attending DBC. (Funny enough, MBA students say the same thing about their MBA degrees, but DBC is a fraction of the cost.)<br/>

		<br/>After watching the video, I still believe DBC is going to be a great experience. It sounds like it's going to be tough, but nothing truly is ever worth it there isn't some significant amount of pain. I have a huge admiration for Shereef and the students in the first cohort- what they did in the early days of DBC was a <strong>HUGE</strong> risk and it looks like it is paying off in droves. It sounds like DBC is still somewhat in it's experimental phase and is still iterating it's business model. We are the lucky few who get's to partake in this relatively new form of education business model.<br/>

		<br/>Since I am naturally an extrovert (with occational introvert moments), I knew after spending a couple of months trying to learn Ruby on my own that I wasn't really learning at the speed that I wanted. I'm a 'social learner' and need to be in a immersive environment with other like-minded individuals. I don't think my perception of DBC has changed since watching Shereef's video. If anything, it put some of my fears at ease hearing that many of the past students went through some of the emotions I'm feeling now and are doing fine. (I'm TOTALLY in the Fear Camp #1.) Particularly the last question he took for the student who was asking about "plagerism" and how he felt like cheating when looking up coding answers on Google. I was always good in school, so trying to break out of the 'don't plagerize' mindset is going to take sometime getting used to.<br/>

		<br/>I am both excited and equally nervous about joining this learning environment. As much as I need to land a job after this experience, I am trying to adjust my mindset that this is a 'learning experience' for me and that the job is a <strong><em>VERY IMPORTANT</em></strong> secondary. I am also taking this opportunity to try and figure out what I want to do after all of this is over. What happens when I discover I am an awful Ruby on Rails engineer? Would I be better suitedin UX design? What about Project Management for a tech company? I would like to think that I have pretty good grasp of my soft skills and am looking to gain some hard tech skills to round me out. For thos of you in the same boat, I found this <a href="http://www.careeradvisordaily.com/how-learning-to-code-helped-my-non-engineering-career/" target="_blank">article</a> incredibly reassuring. 

		<br/>I guess to close this out, whatever happens after DBC, learn, make some friends, and have fun. It's going to be awesome.<br/></p>
